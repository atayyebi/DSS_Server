Phosphorus Loading
</h2>
The phosphorous loading model estimates the amount of phosphorous loaded into surface water each year from a focal location. 
Phosphorous loss estimates for each pixel under the four cropping systems are generated in advance using the EPIC agroecosystem model (Zhang et al. 2010). 
In these precomputed simulations, corn and soybean production uses conventional tillage and optimal amounts of synthetic fertilizer, while alfalfa and grassland simulations assume no tillage and optimal amounts of fertilizer. 
Precomputed estimates of P loss are further modified with an exponential decay function (Soranno et al., 1996) that decreases P loss estimates based on the distance of a location from the nearest stream and the type of land use at a given location. 
Uncertainty of phosphorous loading estimates depends on uncertainty in the many assumptions and parameter estimates in the EPIC agroecosystem model. 
Validations studies have shown that EPIC simulations capture 59% to 87% of the variation in observed phosphorous losses from fields. 
Uncertainty also arises from errors in the assumptions and coefficients incorporated into the exponential decay function. 
The sum of these uncertainties is not known.
