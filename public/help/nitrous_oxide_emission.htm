<h2>
   Nitrous Oxide Emission
</h2>
The N2O estimation is statistical model that predict N2O estimation (Mg ha-1 per year) for focal locations using environmental and management-related factors. 
The inputs of N2O model are climate, soil organic carbon content, soil texture, drainage, soil pH, nitrogen application rate per fertilizer type, and type of crop. 
Soil organic carbon content, soil texture, drainage, and soil pH come from the USDA SSURGO soil geodatabase. 
Climate data comes from the PRISM geodatabase and land cover data comes from the Cropland Data Layer. 
Development of the statistical models is described in Bouwman et al. (2002), who estimate that the uncertainty in model predictions are -40% to + 70%.
