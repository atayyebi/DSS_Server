 Soil Carbon Sequestration
</h2>
Below-ground carbon sequestered on focal land over 20 years (Mg ha-1) was calculated as the sum of soil organic carbon in the top 30 cm of soil and the carbon in below-ground live plant biomass. 
The model starts with a baseline soil carbon estimate, which comes from the USDA SSURGO soil geodatabase, and uses empirical rates of soil carbon change that are dependent upon both baseline soil carbon estimates and land use. 
Regarding uncertainty, the baseline soil carbon estimates have unknown spatial variation and measurement error. 
Soil carbon change factors have standard deviations ranging from 6 to 20%.  The equation that adjusts soil carbon change based on initial carbon has unreported error.  
The method used here is described in West et al. (2008).
