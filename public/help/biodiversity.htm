   About the Model

<h2>
   Bird Habitat Index
</h2>
The grassland bird habitat model produces an index that varies from 0, for poor grassland bird habitat, to 1, for better grassland bird habitat. 
The index is derived from an empirical statistical model, where inputs are the amount of grassland and row crops within a 400 meter radius of a focal cell. 
<br><br>
The model comes from an unpublished analysis by Meehan, of the effects of landscape characteristics on the presence of grassland birds of management concern, using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey conducted in northern Illinois, eastern Iowa, and southern Wisconsin. 
<br><br>
The grassland bird model only explains 16% of the variation in observations of rare grassland bird occurrence
<br><br>
This model is from unpublished work by Tim Meehan while at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
