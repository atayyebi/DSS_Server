    <title>Pest Suppression Model</title>

  <body>
The biocontrol potential model estimates an index of crop-pest removal by arthropod natural enemies that varies from 0, for little pest removal, to 1, for a lot of pest removal.  
The index is derived from an empirical statistical equation. The inputs to the model are the landcover at a focal location and the proportion of grassland within a 1000 meter radius of a focal location.  
The model was derived from studies by Meehan et al. (2013) and Skevas et al. (2014), who measured removal of sentinel crop pests in corn, soybean, and different grassland habitats in Wisconsin and Michigan. 
The biocontrol model explained roughly 80% of the variation in observations of pest removal.
