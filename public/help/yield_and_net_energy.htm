<h2>
		Net Energy Model
	</h2>
	The net-energy model is a simple life-cycle analysis model that predicts the net energy embodied in the ethanol and co-products produced annually with biomass from each pixel of focal land. 
	Net energy is calculated as the gross energy of ethanol and co-products minus the gross life-cycle energy requirements for production. 
	Gross energy of ethanol and co-products depends on feedstock yield at a given pixel, based on the yield model described above, and conversion ratios that convert feedstock to liquid fuel and liquid fuel to units of energy. 
	Gross life-cycle energy requirements of production incorporate energy input during agricultural production, transportation of feedstocks, and processing of feedstocks into fuel and co-products. 
	Uncertainty in estimates comes from uncertainty in yield estimates (discussed below), and uncertainty in energy inputs and conversion ratios, which come from the EBAMM life-cycle assessment model.

  		Crop Yield Model
  	</h2>
	The crop yield models are statistical models that predict typical crop yields (bushels or short tons at standard reporting moisture levels per year) for focal locations based on local soil and topographic characteristics. 
	The inputs to the models are slope, soil depth, percent silt and cation-exchange capacity. 
	Slope estimates are based on a digital elevation model. Soil depth, percent silt, and cation exchange capacity estimates come from the USDA SSURGO soil geodatabase. 
	Depending on the crop, these statistical models describe 72% to 77% of the variation in typical yields reported in SSURGO. 
	Development of the statistical yield models is described in Meehan et al. (2013).
