<h4>
   About the Models
</h4>
<h2>
	Net Income
</h2>
	The net income model is a simple accounting model that predicts annual net income (US dollars) generated from focal locations. 
	Inputs to the net income model include yield estimates from the crop yield model, current crop prices from the Internet, and crop production costs pulled from crop enterprise budgets. 
	Net income is calculated simply as gross returns minus production costs. 
	The accuracy of this estimate depends first on the accuracy of the crop model (described below) and the accuracy of the crop prices and production costs, which can be updated or modified by the user.

  		Crop Yield Model
  	</h2>
	The crop yield models are statistical models that predict typical crop yields (bushels or short tons at standard reporting moisture levels per year) for focal locations based on local soil and topographic characteristics. 
	The inputs to the models are slope, soil depth, percent silt and cation-exchange capacity. 
	Slope estimates are based on a digital elevation model. Soil depth, percent silt, and cation exchange capacity estimates come from the USDA SSURGO soil geodatabase. 
	Depending on the crop, these statistical models describe 72% to 77% of the variation in typical yields reported in SSURGO. 
	Development of the statistical yield models is described in Meehan et al. (2013).
